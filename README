Chrome New Tab Cards Extension
==============================

New Tab Cards is an extension for the Chrome browser.  It replaces the new tab page with customizable card displays for most visited, bookmarks, recently closed, and more.

Install
-------

    npm install

After downloading package dependencies this will run `copy_vendor.sh` and place the few necessary JS and CSS files into the `/src/vendor`.  This keeps the source directory clean for packaging the extension.

TODO
----

In the future we plan on adding:
- A Chrome Apps launcher card
- A current weather card
