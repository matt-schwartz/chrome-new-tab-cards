We don't collect or store any data.  This extension can operate entirely offline and does not need to send or receive any data of any kind to any server or service.  The only required source of data is the Chrome web browser.

If the optional weather card is enabled and a zip code provided, this extension will send your zip code to OpenWeatherMap.org to receive localized weather data. This extension and its developers are not affiliated with OpenWeathMap.org.  To learn how OpenWeatherMap.org handles your data please see their [terms of service](https://openweathermap.org/terms).

The Chrome browser may optionally sync its data, which is displayed by this extension, with Google's services. Please reference the [Google Chrome Privacy Notice](https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/) for terms that apply to the browser itself.
